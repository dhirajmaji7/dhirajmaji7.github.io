                <li>
                    Led the migration of the perception teamâ€™s pointcloud processing pipeline from CPU to GPU using CUDA programming on Nvidia
                    Orin, boosting output frequency by 54% from 13 Hz to 20 Hz and reducing CPU utilization by 15%.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Developed a Pallet Detection pipeline using YOLOv8 in PyTorch, achieving a MAP of 0.91, by training on a curated dataset of
                    real-world and synthetic data, enhancing object detection accuracy for auto pick and place operations. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optimized operational workflows by developing a Lidar-based Freight Dimensioner with 2-inch accuracy, enabling precise
                    measurement of freights, and enhancing navigation and path planning by auto updation of vehicle footprint with freight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contributed to the design of an Autonomous Barcode Detection pipeline with oriented bounding boxes using YOLOv8, achieving a
                    MAP of 0.89, reducing freight misplacement and enhancing inventory tracking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Engineered and implemented simulation environments in Nvidia Isaac Sim, streamlining synthetic data generation and collection
                    workflows for improved efficiency and scalability.
